<summary> Why did the Hundred Years War start? </summary>

The Hundred Years War was a conflict between England and France that lasted from 1337 to 1453. It was one of the most significant wars of the Middle Ages and had a lasting impact on both England and France.

The war had several causes, including political, economic, and personal factors. One of the main causes was the question of the English king's right to rule lands in France. In the late 13th century, King Edward I of England claimed the right to rule the French duchy of Gascony. This led to tensions between England and France, and ultimately to war.

Another cause of the war was the issue of succession to the French throne. In 1328, King Charles IV of France died without a male heir, and the French crown passed to King Edward III of England through his mother, Isabella of France. The French disputed this claim and instead crowned Philip of Valois as their new king. This led to a power struggle and eventually to the outbreak of the Hundred Years War.

Additionally, economic factors played a role in the start of the war. The English and French economies were both expanding, and the two countries were in competition for trade and commerce. This led to tensions and eventually to conflict.

Overall, the Hundred Years War was the result of a complex set of political, economic, and personal factors, and it had a profound impact on the history of England and France.
