# Norman Conquest
 
<details>
<summary>What is Norman Conquest of England and Why is it important in British history?</summary>
The Norman Conquest of England was a significant event in British history that took place in 1066. The Norman Conquest was led by William the Conqueror, a Norman nobleman who became the Duke of Normandy in northern France.

William sought to claim the English throne after the death of King Edward the Confessor in 1066, and he launched an invasion of England with a large Norman army. The Norman forces defeated the English army at the Battle of Hastings, and William was crowned King of England on Christmas Day in 1066.

The Norman Conquest of England is considered one of the most important events in British history because it had a profound impact on the country's political, social, and cultural landscape. The Norman rulers brought with them new ideas and institutions, including the feudal system, which changed the way land was held and administered in England. They also introduced Norman law, which became the basis for the English legal system, and Norman architecture, which influenced the design and construction of churches and castles in England.

In addition, the Norman Conquest led to the Normanization of the English aristocracy, as many of the English nobles were replaced by Norman nobles, who brought with them a Norman cultural and political influence. This Norman influence had a lasting impact on English society, language, and identity, and helped shape the development of England as a nation.

Overall, the Norman Conquest of England was a turning point in British history that marked the beginning of a new era of Norman rule and had a profound impact on the country's political, social, and cultural development.

<summary>Why did England go to the Norman Conquest? </summary>
The Norman Conquest of England in 1066 was a result of several factors, including political rivalries, disputes over the English throne, and the ambitions of Norman nobles.

At the time of the Conquest, England was ruled by King Edward the Confessor, who died without an heir in 1066. This created a power vacuum and several individuals claimed the right to the English throne, including Harold Godwinson, an English nobleman, and William, Duke of Normandy.

William claimed that he had been promised the English throne by King Edward, and when Harold was crowned King of England, William saw this as a challenge to his claim. He gathered a large army and invaded England, culminating in the Battle of Hastings in 1066.

In addition to the political rivalries and disputes over the throne, the Norman Conquest was also driven by the ambitions of Norman nobles, who saw an opportunity to expand their power and influence in England. The Norman nobles were part of the Norman-French aristocracy, which was rapidly expanding its territory in Europe at the time, and the Conquest provided a means for them to gain further wealth and power.

Ultimately, the Norman Conquest of England was a result of a complex interplay of political, social, and cultural factors, and it had a profound impact on the history of England and the development of the British nation.

<summary>What is Magna Carta? </summary>
Magna Carta is a significant historical document signed by King John of England in 1215. It is often considered to be one of the most important legal documents in the history of Western democracy. The term "Magna Carta" is Latin for "Great Charter."

Magna Carta was created as a means of resolving a conflict between the king and the barons, who were powerful landowners and leaders of medieval England. The document established the principle that everyone, including the monarch, was subject to the law and that the king could not act arbitrarily or without the consent of his subjects.

Magna Carta set forth a number of specific rights and liberties, including protection from arbitrary imprisonment, the right to a fair trial, and the principle that taxes could not be levied without the consent of the people.

Over time, Magna Carta became an important symbol of freedom and liberty and was cited as a precedent in later legal battles and disputes, including the American Revolution. Today, it is considered one of the earliest examples of constitutional government and remains a powerful symbol of the struggle for individual rights and democratic governance.

<details>
<summary>What has changed before and after Magna Carta? </summary>
The signing of Magna Carta marked a turning point in the relationship between the monarchy and the people in England, and had far-reaching effects on the development of Western society. Before Magna Carta, the monarch was considered to be above the law and had complete power over the kingdom and its subjects. This led to abuses of power, arbitrary rule, and a general lack of protections for individual rights and liberties.

After Magna Carta, the principle was established that the monarch was subject to the law and that the rights and liberties of the people were protected. This had a profound impact on the development of constitutional government and the rule of law. The document established the principle of due process and limited the power of the monarchy, paving the way for future constitutional developments, such as the Bill of Rights in 1689.

Magna Carta also established the idea that the king could not raise taxes or make decisions without the consent of the people, which laid the foundation for representative government and the development of democratic institutions.

Overall, Magna Carta marked a shift towards a more limited monarchy and a more representative and democratic form of government, and its ideas and principles have had a lasting impact on the development of Western political and legal systems.

# Hundred Years War

<details>
<summary> Why did the Hundred Years War start? </summary>

The Hundred Years War was a conflict between England and France that lasted from 1337 to 1453. It was one of the most significant wars of the Middle Ages and had a lasting impact on both England and France.

The war had several causes, including political, economic, and personal factors. One of the main causes was the question of the English king's right to rule lands in France. In the late 13th century, King Edward I of England claimed the right to rule the French duchy of Gascony. This led to tensions between England and France, and ultimately to war.

Another cause of the war was the issue of succession to the French throne. In 1328, King Charles IV of France died without a male heir, and the French crown passed to King Edward III of England through his mother, Isabella of France. The French disputed this claim and instead crowned Philip of Valois as their new king. This led to a power struggle and eventually to the outbreak of the Hundred Years War.

Additionally, economic factors played a role in the start of the war. The English and French economies were both expanding, and the two countries were in competition for trade and commerce. This led to tensions and eventually to conflict.

Overall, the Hundred Years War was the result of a complex set of political, economic, and personal factors, and it had a profound impact on the history of England and France.

<details>
<summary>Why did the Hundred Years War last so long?</summary>
The Hundred Years War was a series of conflicts fought between England and France from 1337 to 1453. The war lasted for 116 years and was one of the longest and most complex conflicts in medieval history. There were several factors that contributed to the length of the war, including:

1. Territorial Disputes: The war was largely driven by territorial disputes between England and France. Both countries claimed control over certain territories in France, and neither side was willing to give up these claims.
1. Power Struggles: The war was also fueled by power struggles within both England and France. Political factions within each country sought to gain control and influence over their respective governments, and the war provided an opportunity for these factions to assert their power.
1. Military Strategy: The nature of medieval warfare made it difficult for either side to achieve a decisive victory. Armies were often slow to mobilize, and battles were fought with limited technology and resources. This made it difficult for either side to achieve a quick victory and led to a prolonged conflict.
1. Changing Alliances: Over the course of the war, the alliances between various European countries shifted and changed, which complicated the conflict and made it more difficult to bring to a close.
1. Financial Constraints: The cost of maintaining a long and complex war was a major factor in the length of the Hundred Years War. Both England and France struggled to finance the conflict, which limited their ability to field large and well-equipped armies.

Taken together, these factors made it difficult for either England or France to achieve a decisive victory, which contributed to the length of the Hundred Years War. Despite its length and complexity, the war had a significant impact on the political and cultural landscape of both England and France, and it remains an important event in the history of both countries.
